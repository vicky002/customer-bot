## Installation
[:arrow_up: Back to top](#index)

### Clone it
```
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/vicky002/customer-bot.git   [Enter your username and password]

```
Now to start working on the project, please create a branch

```
$ cd customer-bot
$ git checkout -b my_branch_name

```
Now you are in your branch! Make changes, build features or just poke around. 
When you start something new, make sure that you pull all the changes from master branch to your branch.

```
$ git pull origin master   [Then make all the changes]
$ git add your_files and folders
$ git commit -m 'your_commit_message'
$ git push origin my_branch_name

```
That's all! Once you're done with your new feature, create a pull request. Each PR will be reviewed by one of us before it goes to `master` branch. This way we all will be on the same track of what's happening in your codebase.
