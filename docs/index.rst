About CustomerBot
================

CustomerBot is an artifical intelligence messaging platform that puts a small
chatbot in your live chat channles, to answer questions, deflect tickets and free up
your agents.
For more details about the ideas and concepts behind CustomerBot see the :ref: `process flow diagram <process_flow_diagram>`.


An example of typical input would be something like this:

> **user:** Good morning! How are you doing?
> **bot:**  I am doing very well, thank you for asking.
> **user:** You're welcome.
> **bot:** How can I help you?

## How it works

An untrained instance of CustomerBot starts off with no knowledge of how to communicate. Each time a user enters a statement, then library saves the text that they
entered and the text that the statement was in response to. As CustomerBot receives more input the number of response that it can reply and the accuracy of each response
in relation to that statement increase. The system selects the closest matching response by the searching the closet matching known statement that matches the input. For
Customer related queries based on FAQs provided by the organization, system searches for the best match and generates a response.
